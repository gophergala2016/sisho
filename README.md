:books: Sisho stands for `Librarian`.  
It generates `EPUB` file from git-repository with Command Line Interface, for source code reading.

## Usage

```bash
sisho create [pathtogitrepository]

# Example
sisho create github.com/gophergala2016/sisho
```

It works like below.

## Install

You can install it with 2 steps, thank to [homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

```bash
brew tap kogai/sisho
brew install sisho
```


## Feature of future

I have a plan of feature as below.
But maybe it will implement after GopherGala2016 was over.

* Support `.mobi` file.
* Put a link to some declared place of Function or Class.
* Publish it as a Service.

Happy coding! :tada:
